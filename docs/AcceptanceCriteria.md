## User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

- [x] WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

- [x] WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database 

- [x] WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list



## Getting Started:


-  Models

  x  ###User
        
       [x] username
            -string
            -unique
            -required
            -trimmed

        [x] email
            -string
            -required
            -unique
            -valid email address (look into mongoose's matching validation)
        
        [x] thoughts
            -an array of "_id" values referencing the  "Thought"  model

        [x] friends
            -an array of "_id"  values references the "User"  model (self-reference)
        
        [x] Schema Settings: 
            -Create a virtual called "friendCount" that retrieves the length of the user's "friends" array field on query.

    ###Thought
        
        [x] thoughtText
            -string
            -required
            -1-280 characters

 **     [x] createdAt
            -Date
            -Set default value to the current timestamp
            -Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

        [x] username (one who created the thought)
            -String
            -Required

        [x] reactions (these are like replies)
            -Array of nested documents created with the "reactionSchema"

        [x] Schema Settings
            -Create a virtual called "reactionCount" that retrieves the length of the thought's "reactions" array field on query

    ###Reaction (SCHEMA ONLY)

      
        [x] reactionId
            -Use Mongoose's ObjectId datatype
            -Default value is set to a new objectId

        [x] reactionBody
            -string
            -required
            -280 character max
        
        [x] username
            -string
            -required

  **    [x] createdAt
            -Date
            -Set default value to the current timestamp
            -User getter method to format time stamp on query

        [x] Schema Settings
            -This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the "reaction" field's subdocument schema in the "Thought" model.
